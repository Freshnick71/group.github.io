2) Design
3) Button functions
4) (optional) Special funmctions (Bootcamp)
5) Working pages for the app
Button types:

House icon is your home page button. It will navigate you back to the home page every time.

User icon is your account page that has user specified information and certain application features.

Graph icon is the statistics page which includes a leadership board for users with the highest amount of points in the platform. We thought having this will motivate other users to properly be engaged towards the cause. It also rewards the user with varying badges based on either progress or level.

Gift icon is the rewards page which includes the many gifts the user can recieve or convert from cha-ching game points.

User exchange button is the refer a friend page which lets the user know the amount of friends he/she has added to the platform as well as the number of referals sent.

And lastly the locations icon reresents the locations page that links the user to various sites on campus where they can recycle to recieve points on the app.
